## Project Description:
You all might have seen the cool website we had for Codepeak (https://www.codepeak.tech/) this year <br>
But wasn't something missing ??😶 <br>
Yes you guessed it right !! 😉 <br>
Why to fill google forms when you already have your own website.🧐 <br>
So here, we aim to add backend to our website so, that from next time everything can be dynamically controlled. 🤓 <br>
 
## Tech Stack: 
> - Frontend: UI/UX, HTML, CSS, JS, ReactJs <br>
>- Backend: Django, SQL <br>
The project is for full-stack web development from beginner to advanced <br>
